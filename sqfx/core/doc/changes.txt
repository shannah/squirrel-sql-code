SQuirreL SQL FX Change Log
==============================

Feature (Merge request #73): Add possibility to inject JVM arguments via SQUIRREL_SQL_OPTS environment variable.
  Thanks to Antoine Levy-Lambert for thr patch.

Introduced Java 9 compatibility. Java 9 is also required from now on.

Feature (in progress): Query builder: Non DB constraints can be create (using drag and drop) configured and removed (using right mouse menu).

Feature (in progress): Query builder: Double click in 'Add table' now also adds the clicked table to the query builder (usually drag and drop is used).

Feature (in progress): Query builder: Add table dialog is opened automatically when a new query builder is created.

Bug fix: #1271 Splash screen on OSX hangs up SQuirreL

Bug fix: Fixed ExceptionInInitializerError caused by NullPointerException on IOS when the driver configuration dialog was opened.
  Thanks to JÃ¼rgen Weltner for the fix.

Feature (in progress): Query builders can be saved.

Feature: New SQL format option concerning columnConfiguration list splitting
  See menu "File" --> "Global Preferences" --> tab "SQL formatting" --> "Column list split behavior"

Bug fix: Database connection was not closed when Session was closed.

Feature (in progress): Query builder allows to add folding points to constraint lines.

Bug fix: Unquote didn't work when quoted string didn't end with semicolon.

Improvement: SQL-Editor: Tab / Shift+Tab  indents/unindents selected text.

Upgraded RichTextFX to version 0.7-M1

Bug fix: NullPointerException occurred when empty table was rerun.

Feature: Message panel entries and SQL-Error panel text can be copied to clipboard.

Feature (in progress): First steps towards query builder.

Bug fix: ClassCastException occurred in background when create table statement was executed.

Feature: The databases meta data detail tab of the Object tree shows if the driver is JDBC compliant, see java.sql.Driver.jdbcCompliant().

Feature: SQL editor supports search and replace. Keyboard shortcuts are Ctrl+F and Ctrl+H.

Feature: About dialog has a system info tab.

Feature: After rerunning a SQL query the former table layout is restored.

Feature: Made "Properties" button in Alias window work.

Feature: Format SQL has three new options, see menu File -> Settings -> Tab Format SQL
 - Indent sections check box
 - Comma placing radio buttons
 - When AND/OR keywords occur in FROM clauses you can choose to ignore the start new line setting.
   This may be considered to lead to more readable JOIN clauses.


Feature: Object tree offers find and filter functionality. Note that all edit fields involved offer code completion.

Bug fix: Two bug fixes concerning the current SQL mark:
  - StringIndexOutOfBoundsException occurred when the editor was empty and tools popup was opened.
  - The current SQL mark vanished when the split pane divider was moved over the mark.

Feature: SQL editor: The current SQL (SQL that is executed with Ctrl+Enter) is now marked by a box.
  In the settings the color of the box can be chosen or it can be switched off.
  Note: Due to an API function missing in the RichTextFx editor component we are forced to do some advanced calculation
        of the mark's position. The calculation depends on a system dependent line height offset.
        Users probably need to adjust this offset. To adjust the offset open or create a long script
        in the SQL editor. Place the caret inside a statement and open the settings windows.
        Some controls at the General tab allow to adjust the mark online.


Bug fix: When the "SQL to table" function failed during execution of the CREATE TABLE- or INSERT-statement no error message was logged.

Improvement: The progress window that is shown at Session start up offers to open its Alias properties dialog.
  Changing Alias properties can help to accelerate Session start up.

Feature: Schema caching is now implemented. Schema caching is often useful for databases which take a long time to connect to.
   Up to now you could already select this option in the Alias properties dialog but it was treated the same way as "load all, cache non".

Feature: SQL-Editor: Using tools popup (ctrl+T) or right mouse menu to quote/unquote SQL as Java style concatenated string.
         Note: There is also a new setting that allows to automatically copy quoted SQLs to clipboard.

Feature: SQL-Editor: Ctrl+NumblockMinus toggles current SQL or selection between commented and uncommented.

Feature: SQL-Editor: Ctrl+Shift+U toggles selected text between upper and lower case.

Feature: New object tree right mouse menu to copy node names.

Improvement: Duplicate line (ctrl+D) now moves the caret to the duplicated line.

Bug fix: Code completion didn't work right for qualified columns.

Feature: If a table cell is double clicked a cell data display window opens. This window's right mouse menu now offers an entry to reformat Xml or Json strings.

Improvement: Code completion and abbreviations now handle boundary characters like (),=<> better.

Bug fix: Application window size was not saved on application exit.

Bug fix: The "Reconnect database" button switched auto commit mode.

Bug fix: Improved/corrected calculation of table/view closest to the caret once more. Now completion of unqualified columns works better than before.

Feature: Object tree detail tables as well as SQL result meta data tables do now offer the standard right mouse menu.

Bug fix: Fixed encoding bug that made SQuirreL FX crash during start up when for example German umlauts where used for Alias names or elsewhere.

Feature: New menu item to save all settings immediately, see menu File --> "Save all settings"
         Note: Settings are automatically saved on application closing.

Feature: New checkbox in settings "When Aliases are copied Alias properties should be copied too", see menu File --> Settings --> Tab General.

Bug fix: When a connection test within an Alias dialog failed the error message dialog was hidden behind the Alias dialog.

Feature: Delete rows right mouse menu editable in SQL results:
         If a SQL result has been made editable by the pen button on the upper right of the result.
         The results right mouse menu offers a "Delete selected rows" menu item.

Bug fix: Running SQL by clicking the tool bar button used to take the focus off the SQL editor.

Improvement: Double click selection in SQL editor now selects words correctly.

Bug fix: Abbreviations where triggered by any succeeding key not only by space.

Upgraded RichTextFX to version 0.6.10.

Bug fix: Corrected positioning of join generators in completion popup list.

Feature: Join generators: Using code completion (ctrl+space) on the following expressions will generate join clauses:
  - #i,table1,table2,...tableN, will generate inner join from table1 to table2 to ... tableN using constraints between the tables
  - #l,table1,table2,...tableN, will generate left join from table1 to table2 to ... tableN using constraints between the tables
  - #j,table1,table2,...tableN, will generate left/inner join from table1 to table2 to ... tableN using constraints between the tables
    and depending on the foreign keys' nullability

Bug fix: Code completion did not work inside columnConfiguration lists that were separated by commas but no white spaces.

Improved connect progress dialog to show progress information.

Bug fix: Code completion did'nt calculate the table/view closest to the caret right. That's why completion of unqualified columns was sometimes wrong.

More improved Object tree performance: Details tabs data are now loaded on demand.

Bug fix: Search in SQL result table didn't work when user had rearranged columnConfiguration orders.

Feature: New setting in settings dialog to limit number of SQL result tabs.

Bug fix: When selection inside a SQL result table is in progress and the mouse pointer is dragged right or left out of the table the table did not scroll.

Removed the maximum Java-VM memory parameter (-Xmx512m) from the Windows start batch. Java should be able to manage its memory itself.

Feature: Search in SQL result table.

Bug fix: Appending an SQL from SQL history to the editor does not add a new line anymore if the editor is empty.

Improved Object tree performance: Details tabs are now loaded on demand.

Bug fix: Tools popup and bookmarks popup didn't scroll right when up or down key was used.

Feature: Alias name in SQL history search dialog.

Upgraded RichTextFX to version 0.6.6 and fixed the code completion problem that resulted from changes in RichTextFX, see some paragraphs below.
  Note: This makes SQuirreL FX compatible with jdk1.8.0_60.

Bug fix: When an area of a result table was selected that exceeded valid columns, a NullPointerException occurred when any table copy function was executed.

Bug fix: File handling now remembers the last directory.

Bug fix: Fixed memory leak concerning toolbar buttons.
  Excerpt from Steven Zecks mail announcing the problem:
  "Part of the problem now is the ToolbarButtonsHandler from commit 54d130.
  I used the ActionUtils/ActionManager/ActionHandle classes to manage the rerun SQL button and action in the results tab ...
  But now when the results tab is closed and/or rerun, the _buttons list in ToolbarButtonsHandler isn't cleared, causing a memory leak."

Feature: File save, open etc. in SQL editor.

Feature: Toolbar buttons and menus that have Session wide concern (e.g. transaction buttons or schema reload button)
   are now automatically available in a Session's main tab as well as in additional SQL tabs.

Feature: Rerun current open results tab (ctrl+shift+enter) or using icon

Bug fix: Wrong messages when transactions where committed/rollbacked.

Bug fix: Code completion didn't work right on Windows: When the completion popup was opened using ctrl+space the space character was still added to the editors text.
